\section{Introduction}

Most tools we use today, from wristwatches and squirt guns to smartphones and industrial softwares, rely on sophisticated technology hidden from the user. This require the user to be taught how to use the tool, which can be done with written instructions and trial-and-error, but also by designing the tool in such a way that its usage is both obvious and simple.\\

While design has been done for centuries for physical objects by using buttons, elaborate shapes, different materials, etc, the most recent computing devices tends to have a simplistic physical design (often reduced to a black surface with a touchscreen) and use software elements on the screen to interact with the user by touch, leaving much of the design to the application creator.\\

According to recent market research such as \cite{ABI-android}, the iPad from Apple is still the most sold tablet in the world. Its user base is so huge that several companies base their entire business model on selling apps for it. In an App Store containing almost a million different apps (\cite{iOs61}), users searching an app for a particular use may find dozens of different iterations. Studying how to apply design principles in tablet application design may help to make an application easy to use and to understand, and thus standing out against competitors.\\

In this document, we concentrate on design trends in electronic tablet applications. In Sect.~\ref{sct:theory}, we present some of the basic design principles described in Donald Norman's ``Design of everyday things'' \cite{Norman02} which can be applied to the design of any object.\\

Then, in Sect.~\ref{sct:history}, we show how those principles can be recognized in the evolution of the design of computer systems, concluding with the current trends in electronic tablets, namely skeuomorphism and flat design.\\

Finally, in Sect.~\ref{sct:experiment}, we present experimentation results demonstrating how users react to those designs. One result is from our own experiment, in which we confronted various users to a skeuomorphic calculator application and to a flat one.\\

\section{Theoretical concepts and design principles}

A given object can have hundreds of possible interaction with an user. Design is used to highlight its intended usage using two concepts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perceived affordance suggests the good alternatives
\item Constraints limit the number of bad alternatives
\end{enumerate}

In this section, we present those concepts theoretically and we give some examples of their utilization.

\label{sct:theory}

    \subsection{Perceived affordance}
        \subsubsection{Definition}
Perceived affordance represents the quality of an object that suggest its utilization. This concept is very important in object-design due to the fact that it represents the only source of information on the usage of the object if the user does not read the usage notice. Moreover, this concept may reinforce the feeling of experience of a person for a given object.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{fig-report/switches-only.png}
\caption{By their forms, buttons,switches or knobs often suggest their working.}
\end{figure}

Perceived affordance is not real affordance (\cite{affordancesMads}): design can rarely explain the complete working of complex objects. Perceived affordance shows primitive properties of its usage. This is why a bad design induces a difficult usage of the object, such as in Fig.~\ref{fig:lift-bad-design}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.20]{fig-report/bad-switches.jpg}
\caption{What would you do in front of such a lift panel?}
\label{fig:lift-bad-design}
\end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Natural mapping}
Natural mapping is the idea of organizing controllers in the same arrangement as the objects on which they have an influence. This principle will often lead to an increase in perceived affordance.\\

A common example is the placement of the buttons that control the different stoves in a kitchen (see Fig.~\ref{fig:natural-mapping-1}~\&~\ref{fig:natural-mapping-2}, taken from \cite{stoveMapping}). It's obvious that the most left-top button will regulate the temperature of the most left-top stove.\\
 \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
      \centering
      \begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
          \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
              \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{fig-report/stove_natural.png}
              \caption{Scheme of a four stoves set with their corresponding knobs with natural mapping}
              \label{fig:natural-mapping-1}
          \end{figure}
      \end{minipage}
      \hspace{0.05\linewidth}
      \begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
          \begin{figure}[H]
                    \centering
              \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig-report/NormanBurners.jpg}
              \caption{Knobs arrangement without natural mapping, with varying success in perceived affordance.}
              \label{fig:natural-mapping-2}
          \end{figure}
      \end{minipage}
  \end{minipage}
  \bigskip

Unfortunately, this principle induces extra design cost and also depends on the point of view of the designer: even if it seems logical for certain arrangement such as stoves or the control of the electronic windows of the car, one can still doubt about the mapping of light switches(\textit{"Does the highest switch controls the front lights?"}).

    \subsubsection{Feedback}
\newtheorem{mydef}{Definition}
\begin{mydef}
\textit{\textbf{Feedback}}: sending information back to the user about his actions and their consequences.
\cite{Norman02}
\end{mydef}

In our case, feedback represents any action that could indicate to the user that its interaction with the item was taken into account. In certain cases, feedback can be done implicitly by the quality and the design of the object itself. For example, some buttons make a clicking sound when pressed. With modern technology however, feedback often requires additional functions like vibration or sound that corresponds to states of the device (see Fig.~\ref{fig:feedback}). These retro-actions have to provide the user with enough information to prevent a mistaken usage to cause frustration.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{fig-report/retro-action-speaking.jpg}
\caption{After the user gives a command, the device emits a sound to confirm that it is analysing the request}
\label{fig:feedback}
\end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Additional design principles}

While perceived affordance and constraints are the two main concept in object design, the author of \cite{Norman02} also present the following concepts:

\begin{description}
    \item [Conceptual model:] The idea is to provide a precise information model about the correct usage or maintenance of the object. By following instructions, users should be guaranteed to use the item correctly. The design of such scheme is really important and should be extremely clear. Indeed, if it's not, the user may be frustrated and not understand why it's not working. An example is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:concept-model}.

    \item [Make things visible] Certain of our modern items can be seen as real complex state machines due to the number of actions they can propose, causing the need for a display showing the current state and available actions. A good example is VoIP telephones allowing users to start a conference call with several other people, such as in Fig.~\ref{fig:make-things-visible}. Such telephones are equipped with a large display which can show different contacts numbers, propose features to start conference call or even to place a call on hold in order to answer to another call.
\end{description}

              \label{fig:make-things-visible}
          \end{figure}
      \end{minipage}
  \end{minipage}

    \subsection{Constraints}
    In addition to perceived affordance, usage of objects is also induced by different types of constraints. These constraints allow the user to immediately discard an incorrect interaction of the object.

        \subsubsection{Physical constraints}
        These constraints are the strongest because they considerably reduce the number of possible usages: they make incorrect usages clearly not physically possible, preventing the user to even try them. Such constraints do not or poorly depend on the knowledge of the user.\\

        $\underline{Example:}$\\
        Due to the design of the toolbox in Fig.~\ref{fig:phys-constr-toolbox}, it's completely impossible for the user to put, for example, his hammer into the slot reserved for a screwdriver.
        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{fig-report/toolbox.jpg}
        \caption{A toolbox designed with physical constraints}
        \label{fig:phys-constr-toolbox}
        \end{figure}

        \subsubsection{Semantic constraints}
       In opposition to physical constraints, semantic constraints require a good knowledge of the situation in which the object should be used.\\

        $\underline{Example:}$\\
        Shoes design often supposes that the user knows how to make a correct knot. Users will discard alternatives because they have knowledge of the situation.

        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{fig-report/tie_your_shoes.jpg}
        \end{figure}

        \subsubsection{Cultural constraints}
        These constraints are the consequences of cultural conventions. These constraints can be considered arbitrary because in most of the cases, several possible alternatives could be applicable. Indeed such constraints do not affect the semantic or physical usage of the given object. Unfortunately, these constraints may change depending on the the geographical and temporal context. Furthermore these constraints are not applicable to new type of objects.\\

        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{fig-report/japan-traffic-light.jpg}
        \caption{Japanese traffic lights are designed with different cultural constraints}
        \label{fig:cultural-constr-traffic-light}
        \end{figure}

        $\underline{Example:}$\\
        An example is the disposition and color of traffic lights. In western countries, the green color means that you can pass, and traffic lights are positioned in a vertical column . In Japan however, traffic lights may be composed of blue, orange and red lights, and could be displayed as a horizontal row, such as in Fig.~\ref{fig:cultural-constr-traffic-light}.

        \subsubsection{Logical constraints}
        These constraints call to the good sense of the user, regardless of their physical or cultural knowledge. The correct usage should be the first and logical assumption of user through design choices. Such constraints are often linked to natural mapping.\\

        $\underline{Example:}$\\
        When using a frying pan with a clearly visible and unique handle, the user will immediately understand the correct usage of it, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:log-constr-fryingpan}.

        \begin{figure}[h]

        \caption{The frying pan on the right has less chance to be handled incorrectly, has there is only one handle to try}

\section{Evolution of computers interface}
\label{sct:history}

    \begin{figure}[h]

        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig-report/timeline-interface.png}
        \caption{Main events in the evolution of computer interfaces}
        \label{fig:timeline}
    \end{figure}

    As soon as computers became available to the public, the question of design came into play. While early designs were rough as computers were mainly aimed at professional use, the trend of personal computing brought a need for refined designs aimed at non-technical users. In this section, we present different types of computer interfaces for personal computing devices and explain them in terms of design principles.

    \subsection{Command line interpreter (CLI)}

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{fig-report/terminal.png}
        \caption{A typical CLI showing the content of a directory. Color is used for highlighting certain informations}
        \label{fig:cli}
    \end{figure}

    The first attempt at an usable design for computing devices was the Command-Line Interface (CLI). The user can interact with the device using a keyboard by typing commands to launch programs, then the output of the program is displayed on the screen. While typing, the current command is displayed next to a cursor to provide feedback to the user. The buttons of the keyboard are labeled and follow a pattern standardized by countries, which is a case of natural mapping and cultural constraints.\\

    Command-line interfaces were introduced in the 1960s and remained a de-facto standard until the introduction of graphical interfaces. Later iterations were improved by features as auto-completion (which improved the perceived affordance of possible commands) and colors (which helped the user to build a conceptual model). Note that while CLI are not used as a main interface in personal computers anymore, advanced users still use them in certain cases due to their efficiency.

    \subsection{Graphical interface and computer mouse}

    Invented in 1963 and made famous in 1968 during the ``Mother of All Demos''\cite{engelbart1968research}, the computer mouse coupled with an OS using a graphical interface allow the user to interact with the space of the screen. Graphical interfaces allowed designers to use powerful visual metaphors to construct an intuitive conceptual model (i.e. start button, trashbin, desktop, etc), as well as providing visual feedback to the user (movement of the mouse cursor, highlighting of selected items, animation when minimizing program).\\

    Graphical interfaces and their intuitive conceptual model helped the broad adoption of personal computers. They are still the main interfaces used today, even if some operating systems are now pushing for a shift to touch interfaces. The latest iterations concentrate on higher-resolution icons and more complex animations.

   \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

    \subsection{Touch interface}

    Introduced in 1973 (citation), the touchscreen seems to be the logical evolution of the computer mouse, as it allow the user to interact directly with the screen rather than using peripheral devices such as the mouse and the keyboard. Touch interfaces may use virtual and familiar devices such as buttons and switches whose affordance will be instantly recognized by the user, and actions such as moving a file or resizing an image can also be accomplished by intuitive movements such as dragging a finger across the screen or using to fingers to pinch.\\
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=2]{fig-report/first-touchscreen.jpg}
\caption{First invented touchscreen by E.A. Johnson in 1965 at the Royal Radar Establishment in Malvern, United Kingdom\cite{first-touchscreen}}
\end{figure}
    While touchscreens seem to be a straight upgrade in terms of conceptual model, they lack the precision and haptic feedback given by the mouse and keyboard. While this problem is partially solved by advances in technologies and vibrators embedded in the device, touch interfaces are not used in the majority of personal computers nowadays, especially in professional environments. However, the technology is now widely used in smartphones and in the new market of electronic tablets.

    \subsection{Voice interface}

    With early appearances as soon as in the 1920s, voice interfaces is an old idea whose usability is highly dependent on advances in the fields of speech recognition and semantical analysis. While the latest commercial voice interfaces allow to recognize many languages with a low rate of errors, current interfaces only allow users to input simple commands in a limited set of languages. They are rarely used by most users (as found by \cite{SiriNotUsed} which studied Apple's Siri), so we chose not to concentrate on it in this report.

    \subsection{Neural interface}
    With the latest development in neuroscience, designers are able to limit the interface to a single chip in the brain of the user. Such technology is mainly dedicated to disabled people who cannot use the previously described interfaces. For example, Brown University researchers succeeded in helping a paralyzed woman to move a robotic arm with a wireless chip implemented in her brain \cite{brownRobotic}. Transmitting information directly from the user's brain to a machine could in the future become more affordable and a new standard in term of interface design.
    
    \begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{fig-report/robotic-arm-brain.jpg}
    \caption{A 58-year-old woman, paralyzed by a stroke for almost 15 years, uses her thoughts to control a robotic arm, grasp a bottle of coffee, serve herself a drink, and return the bottle to the table\cite{brownEdu}.}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Current trends in touch interface}

    Early design of touchscreen devices were often derived from classical mouse-based design, with the screen touches interpreted as mouse clicks. These devices remained a niche market until the introduction of devices designed from the ground up for touch-based devices. We now present two design paradigms which are used nowadays for these type of devices.

        \subsubsection{Skeuomorphism}
        \begin{defn}
        \textit{Skeuomorph:} An object or feature which imitates the design of a similar artefact made from another material. From the greek words $\sigma \kappa \varepsilon \upsilon {\rm o} \zeta$ (tool) and $\mu {\rm o} \rho \varphi \eta$ (shape).
        \end{defn}

        This design paradigm was first introduced in 2007 with Apple's iOS operating system for their iPhone and iPad devices, both highly successful and followed by other devices with a similar design. Skeuomorphic applications try to mimic an existing object in order to feel familiar to the user.\\

        For example, a skeuomorph dialer application may display a picture of an analog wheel-shaped dialer and ask the user to turn the virtual wheel in a movement familiar to him. While the user is inputting a number, the application may play the sounds of the wheel turning and a bell ringing. This type of application has very clear affordance, an intuitive conceptual model and provides efficient feedback, as long as the user is familiar with the mimicked tool.\\

        Skeuomorphic applications are often characterized by realistic textures, glossy elements and gradient backgrounds, resulting in a three-dimensional feel.

        \subsubsection{Flat design}
        \begin{defn}
        \textit{Flat design} \cite{whatIsFlat}: minimalistic design approach that emphasizes usability. It features clean, open, crisp edges, bright colours and two-dimensional/flat illustrations.
        \end{defn}

        While skeuomorphic designs helped the broad adoption and usage of touch-based devices thanks to their familiar conceptual model, they also add many superfluous details which can distract the user from the relevant usage of the application. Their complex design can cause a higher battery usage and eye fatigue to the user, as well as limiting the usability of the application to the one of the object it tries to mimic (for example, a truly skeuomorphic dialer cannot autocomplete phone numbers based on the user's contact list).\\

        Hence the recent rise of the Flat design, in which all superfluous elements are removed. These designs tend to be minimalist and to have a two-dimensional iconic feel. An early example is the controversial \textit{Metro} interface for Windows 8, and later the iOS7 update which signified a paradigm shift in Apple's design.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sct:experiment}

    \subsection{Definition of the experiment}

    To compare skeuomorph and Flat design, we presented our subjects with two different calculator applications on iPad. One had a familiar skeuomorph design and the other had an original but intuitive design, based on Flat principles. After a quick demonstration of both apps, the subject was asked to answer simple questions using both applications. The quiz is available as an appendix.\\

    % Figure showing the two apps...

    \subsection{Results analysis}

    \subsubsection{First exercise: travel bill}

    Subjects were asked to calculate expenses made during a trip, based on various receipts. Most chose the skeuomorph calculator. We suppose that due to simplicity of operations, they think the familiar calculator will be enough to solve the question. In general, the subjects arrived at the correct amount.\\

    When we asked them to give us only the money spent on taxi fares, they could not answer because the computation steps were not labeled. Note that this is not possible with a real calculator either. When the flat calculator was used, the subjects tend to use as many features as possible (labels, dedicated functions). As a result, the users were able to tell us about the details of the bill.\\

    Some subjects had a problem with the skeuomorph calculator as it was not working as the ones  they daily use (especially the syntax of the percent function). In that case, the skeuomorph design loses its usability gain and even harms the conceptual model of the user.\\

    \subsubsection{Second exercise: tax computation}

    In the second part of the experiment, we forced the subjects to choose the other calculator (Most of the time, \textit{Soulver}).\\

    Most of the subjects were lost due to uncommon interface. Indeed, the numeric pad is not highlighted and Soulver proposes many functions (such as percent computation or simple equation solving). Instead of using dedicated functions, they tried to use their mathematical knowledge to solve the equations. As a consequence, results (but also computation time) were not as good as in the first exercise.\\

    Once we showed them the additional functions in details, users appeared to be pleasantly surprised that the application integrates such features: Most of them explained us that they didn't see it because it's not emphasized and suggested that developers should use different button designs (color, shape, text color, etc). A well-received feature of the flat calculator is the fact that it integrates a labeled history in which users can add textual information, making the sub-resolution problems easier.\\

    In general, users couldn't use the full potential of the flat calculator due to the lack of information. At first sight, and due to a limited design, users appeared lost and limited their actions to the simple arithmetic instead of exploiting the dedicated functions to compute percentage or solve basic equations. Several users admitted that they wanted to use the flat calculator for everyday operations (shopping list, bills, etc), but only after a small training session because to counterbalance their lack of mathematical knowledge.\\

    \subsubsection{Third question: Flat design in practice}
    In conclusion to our experiment, we asked our subjects what they thought of either the new design of iOS 7 proposed by Apple or the interface of Microsoft's Windows 8, whichever was the most familiar to the subject.\\

    Subjects estimated that the new flat design is more beautiful and abstract without much loss in terms of usability, even if older users admitted that the flat design required a short adaptation:
  	(In french) \textit{Colette} - \textit{"Lors de la mise à jour, j'ai été surprise et un peu perdue parce que toutes les icones avaient changées. Après deux ou trois jours d'utilisation, je me suis adaptée. Si on devait revenir au précédent design, ce serait une perte de temps étant donné que je devrais m'y ré-adapater."}

    \subsection{Comparison with previous studies}
    This is a subject where other studies are uncommon or mostly incomplete. This make it difficult to compare, the three different studies that have been chosen and that will be exposed are: A blog post about design that ask users about their preference, the windows 8 forum where a report over the preference between windows 7 and 8 is posted. Finally the last study is a Japanese one, from the Department of Industrial Design National Cheng Kung University. This tries to analyze the different types of icons and to class them between the abstract-concrete and detailed-terse factors.

    \subsubsection{Flat VS skeuomorphism}

    The first survey \cite{flatVSskeuomorphisme} asked the users to choose their favorite between a set of icons from Android, IOS6, IOS7 and Windows Phone. Their results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:flat-vs-skeu-result}\\

    \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{fig-report/flatVSskeuomorphism.png}
    \caption{Results found in the flat vs. skeuomorphism experiment presented in \cite{flatVSskeuomorphisme}}
    \label{fig:flat-vs-skeu-result}
    \end{figure}

    Considering that all except IOS6 are flat design, more than 70\% of the participant vote for flat design in each case. The main problem with this study is that there is no skeuomorph icons for google and windows phone. The majority of the icons being flat influence the results so that this is hard to belief. Another interesting thing is that windows 8 got a really low score for his calendar application. The three other possibilities looks similar and got an higher scores, leading to the conclusion that people really do not like this icon.

    \subsubsection{Windows 8 survey, half prefer windows 7\cite{windows8Survey}}

    This survey is made by Microsoft for Windows users, and thus should be taken with care. That being said, the informations revealed by the survey are quite interesting. The Metro UI (flat user interface) is classed in the 9th position of the most liked features with 22\% of the people liking it, while the fact to having two types of desktop, the Metro and the classical is disliked by 18\% of the people, putting it in the fifth place of the weaknesses to be improved.\\

    We can ask ourself if the ones that voted for the Metro UI are not the same ones that voted for the double interface to be useless, because of the fact that the ones that are the most convinced of the flat interface should be the ones seeing a double interface to be the most useful or ineffective.\\

    By summing up all the votes, we can observe that on average, each voter has voted twice more for liked features than for weaknesses. Other surveys showed that in fact two Windows user out of three still uses Windows 7, a preference that could be caused by the price (35\% of the survey seeing this as one of the weaknesses) or lots of other factors that are not specially caused by the new UI.\\

    The results concludes by showing the corresponding graphs and graphs about the tablets. We should keep in mind that the results are from September 2012, before the introduction of iOS7 (September 2013). Globally, Android leads the market with one third of all mobile devices, one quarter of the cake was taken by iOS6 and Windows one quarter for the phones and one third for the tablets. This last information is interesting: while Android and IOS globally get the same part of the market, Windows seems to be preferred on a bigger touchscreen device. This is caused by the fact that their new UI is thought to be used on flat, touchscreen computers and tablets. This is very representative and could lead to the conclusion that Microsoft uses the flat design for other kind of devices, and thus should be used together instead of compare them.

    \subsubsection{A preliminary study on aesthetic of apps icon design}

    This study \cite{jpAnalitics} is made by a Japanese university with the collaboration of two members of the Department of Industrial Design National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan. It tries to analyze and determine the different aspects of the aesthetic in the icons, the links between them and with the users and finally investigate the new issues to the skeuomorphism, meaning the flat design. To get the results, they use evaluation grid results, quantification theory and regression to identify potential relationships between constituent of the icons. They also introduce the kansei interface concept that try to include the emotional principle in the UI.\\

    The kansei interface is a principle that gets the general principle of usability, but also add a positive emotion factor with what they call interactive motivation. This is used in the context of the app market, with lots of app doing the same things and where the need is to interest the user to look at your app, the icon being the representation of the application behind it. It should create emotion to get interest, motivation to look further, and usability to understand the purpose.\\

    The survey is make in three part, first designers that analyzed the aesthetic factor of the icons, secondly three of them decided the final aesthetic structure of the icons. Finally 42 participant respond to a grid survey over they feeling of the icons. The figure \ref{jpfig5} in the appendix show the result of the second part.\\

    Third part begin with a questionnaire asking for the different type of icons to be attractive. The following results show that the more abstract it becomes, the less attractive it is. We can also observe that concrete icons have more success than abstract (flat) ones.

      }
      \caption{Figure 6 of the study \label{jpfig6}}
    \end{figure}

    After this, a real questionnaire was given and the results were used to build a correlation between previously analyzed factors and the fact that the icons where cute, vigorous, intuitive and fun. For example, to be vigorous, an icon should have a 3D effect, color, dynamic elements and novelty. The full table is present in the appendix, see figure \ref{jppage8}. This was made with the purpose of attempting to define the axis of the map as concrete-abstract and detailed-terse. See figure\ref{jpfig7}\\

    Based on the map, a second questionnaire was also made to compare the preference between concrete and abstract (or skeuomorph and flat design) icons. The results shows that most people prefer concrete style icons.

    \subsubsection{Conclusion of the articles}
        The small quantity of sources make it difficult to get a conclusion, but by referring to the two last ones, we could expect that our experiment would lead to a preference of the old, concrete style, where people knows how to make it work in comparison to a new flat design where they will not find they mark

\section{Conclusion}

In this document, we presented some of the ideas and challenges for the design of applications for touch-screen based devices. In particular, we compared two visual languages used in most tablet operating system: Flat and Skeuomorph. Note that there are of course other factors to take into account when designing an application such as spatial layouts, color palette, screens arrangement, etc.\\

While skeuomorph designs have been used when touch-based devices were first introduced to the public and have greatly helped their wide adoption, it now seems that both designers and users have grown tired of their inherent complexity and inefficiency. This lead to the adoption of minimalist designs with sharp edges and bright colors, or Flat design.\\

While skeuomorphism worked well for non-technical people thanks to their immediate conceptual model, the shift to Flat force applications creator to concentrate on an immediately intuitive design. This was very clear in our experiment, where subjects instinctively chose the skeuomorph application over the Flat one, which offered more feature but seemed complex to use. When using the flat application, our subjects often missed the more advanced features, and seemed confused when using them.
